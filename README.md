This is an Instagram Clone project that I've created 

The project aims to improve my JavaScript skills by practicing manipulating objects and accessing the data within the object.  

All the posts are rendered and written in javascript with very little HTML to structure the web page

Here are the technical skills applied in this project:

Dynamic Content Rendering:
- The project emphasizes dynamically rendering posts using JavaScript based on the data array (posts).
- Using a function (renderPosts) allows for efficient and scalable rendering of posts, ensuring a responsive user interface.

User Interaction with Posts:
- Including like icons allows users to interact with posts by liking them.
- Hover effects on the like icon provide a visual cue for users, enhancing the interactive aspect of the application.

Responsive Design:
- The project pays attention to the responsiveness of the design, ensuring that the layout adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
- Flexbox is utilized for creating a flexible and visually pleasing layout.
  
Array-Based Data Handling:
- The project focuses on handling post data using an array structure (posts), making it scalable for potential future additions or modifications.
